# example conf file for gitosis-lite

# comments in the normal shell-ish style; no surprises there

# objectives, over and above gitosis:
#     - simpler syntax
#     - no gitweb/daemon control
#     - allows ff/non-ff control
#     - allows branch level control

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# user groups; syntax:
#   @groupname = username [...]
# too many users?  just add more such lines
# (they accumulate, like squid ACLs)

@customers = cust1 cust2
@customers = cust99
@interns = indy james
@staff = me alice
# you can nest groups; they'll be fully expanded in actual use
@staff = bob @interns
@secret_staff = bruce whitfield martin

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# each section pertains to one or more repo(s); syntax:
#   repo reponame [...]
#   (R|RW|RW+) [list of ref names] = [list of users]

#     - RW+ means non-ff push is allowed
#     - if no ref name exists, the rule applies to all refs
#     - ref names are perl regex patterns
#         - suffixed by "$"
#         - prefixed by "refs/heads/" if it doesn't start with "refs/"
#           (i.e., tags have to be explicitly named as refs/tags/pattern)

#     - the order of entries matters: the first ref+action line (for the repo)
#       that matches is what counts.  If the user is listed, the action is
#       allowed, otherwise it is rejected.

#     - list of users can use any group name defined earlier
#     - "@all" is a special, predefined, groupname

# anyone can play in the sandbox
repo sandbox
    RW+     = @all

# my repo and alice's repo have the same memberships and access, so we just
# club them
repo myrepo alicerepo
    RW+     = me  alice
    R       = bob  eve

repo custrepo
    RW      = @customers
    R       = @staff

# idea for the tags syntax shamelessly copied from git.git
# Documentation/howto/update-hook-example.txt :)
